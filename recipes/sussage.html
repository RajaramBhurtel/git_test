    Among the different varieties of Nepali food available, momo is one of the most popular items. In fact, momos are so popular in Nepal that almost every restaurant offers it on their menu. It’s also very popular in London, so much so that guests often ask us for the recipe for our chicken, mutton, and vegetarian momos!

 

    Wait, what’s a “momo”?
